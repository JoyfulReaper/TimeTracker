# Time Tracker
This project allows tracking the amount of time spent on projects.

Categories and subcategories can be used to organize projects. Entries can then be added to these projects. The total time spent on all projects can then be tracked, along with the amount of time spent per project, category and subcategory.

I am currently seeking employment as a developer.
This project shows my ability to understand, work with, and implement the following:


C#

ASP.NET Web API

SQL Server

Dapper


Please feel free to contact me if interested in talking about this project, C#, or employment opportunities. Thanks for reading!
